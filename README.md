    <strong align="center"><h3>UPDATE:</h3> As of November 28th, 2022, ValoStats will be offline from Discord. The platform used to host this bot, Heroku, will no longer allow hosting for free. At this time, I do not have the funds to be able to continue hosting ValoStats. Additionally, the API usage with Tracker Network has changed and the bot cannot retrieve stats properly. 
<br><br>In the future, I may plan to use Riot's official Valorant API and revive this project. 
<br><br>I am proud to inspire hundreds of other bright developers to make a Valorant Stats Discord bot like this. I am also pleased that thousands of Valorant users have been able to use and enjoy my first big side project for their gaming experience.
<br><br>Thank you for supporting and using ValoStats for the past year.
